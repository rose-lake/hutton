# Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell

This repository contains all my work, notes, and in-book examples from Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell.

I began working in this book during my mini-batch at the Recurse Center in February 2020. I continued working in it over the following weeks, but also spent time on other projects, including beginning to work through HPFP (Haskell Programming from First Principles).

# State
- Reading chapter 5
- Currently at 5.4

# to do
- incorporate the information/examples from haskell-io folder
- be sure to copy, not cut-paste, these into here, since haskell-io has its own git history
