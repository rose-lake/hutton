# Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell

This repository contains all my work, notes, and in-book examples from Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell.

I began working in this book during my mini-batch at the Recurse Center in February 2020. I continued working in it over the following weeks, but also spent time on other projects, including beginning to work through HPFP (Haskell Programming from First Principles).

# The Code
Lives in [`src/`](https://github.com/rose-lake/hutton/tree/master/src) folder.

## chapter 1: Introduction
- Functions, Functional Programming
- Quicksort, sequencing actions

## chapter 2: First Steps
- GHC, GHCi, a quick tour of the Standard Prelude

## chapter 3: Types and Classes
- A quick tour of commonly used built-in types, Lists, and Tuples
- function type signatures, currying, polymorphic types, class constraints
- basic classes: Eq, Ord, Show, Read, Num, Integral, Fractional

## chapter 4: Defining Functions
- if-then-else, guards
- pattern matching, also on tuples, also on lists
- lambda expressions
- operator sections; partially applied functions

## chapter 5: List Comprehensions
- generators, guards
- zip function
- String comprehensions
- The Ceasar Cipher: extended example

## chapter 6

## chapter 7

## chapter 8: Declaring Types and Classes
- type, data, and newtype declarations
- recursive types
- class and instance declarations
- Tautology checker: extended example

## chapter 9

## chapter 10: Interactive Programming
- IO type, IO actions, `do` notation
- examples of building up primitive actions (included in Standard Prelude) from just three basic IO actions: `getChar`, `putChar`, and `return`
- extended examples:
  - Hangman
  - Nim
  - Game of Life


## Summary
- completed: chapters: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10
- on deck:
    - chapter 6
    - chapter 7
    - chapter 10 :: Optional: exercise 6: I want to do this exercise and add it to hangman!
    - chapter 12 :: exercises 1-8.
