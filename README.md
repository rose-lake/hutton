# Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell

This repository contains all my work, notes, and in-book examples from Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell.

I began working in this book during my mini-batch at the Recurse Center in February 2020. I continued working in it over the following weeks, but also spent time on other projects, including beginning to work through HPFP (Haskell Programming from First Principles).

# to do
- incorporate the information/examples from haskell-io folder
- be sure to copy, not cut-paste, these into here, since haskell-io has its own git history

# State
- Currently at 5.7: Chapter Exercises
  - Exercise 9

# Summary
- working on: chapter 5
- on deck:
    - chapter 10 :: Optional: exercise 6  
        - I want to do exercise 6 and add it into hangman!
    - Chapter 12 ::
        - read it.
        - do exercises 1-4.
        - maybe 5. 6 could be hard. 7 is hard.
