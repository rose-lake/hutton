HW :: do exercises 3, 4, 5

3. The script below contains 3 syntactic erros. Correct them and make sure your script works using GHCi

    -- original script ::
    N = a `div` length xs
        where
            a = 10
            xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

4. The library function last selects the last element of a non-empty list. Show how the function last can be implemented using the functions already introduced in chapter 2. Then, can you think of a different way to do it?

    -- one way
    last' :: Num a => [a] -> a
    last' [] = error "Can't have a last element of an empty list!"
    last' l = sum (drop ((length l) - 1) l)
    -- another way
    last'' :: Num a => [a] -> a
    last'' [] = error "Can't have a last element of an empty list!"
    last'' l = head (reverse l)
    -- a third way
    last''' :: Num a => [a] -> a
    last''' [] = error "Can't have a last element of an empty list!"
    last''' l = l !! (length l - 1)

5. The library function init removes the last element from a non-empty list. Show how init can be similarly defined in two different ways.

    -- one way
    init' :: [a] -> [a]
    init' [] = error "Can't have an init of an empty list"
    init' l = take (length l - 1) l
    -- another way
    init'' :: [a] -> [a]
    init'' [] = error "Can't have an init of an empty list"
    init'' l = reverse (tail (reverse l))
    -- couldn't think of a third way this time...
